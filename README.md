# kubernetes-model

Go language bindings for kubernetes model (and possibly operations, later).


### Overview
Generated structs representing the Kubernetes API model. Structs are generated by interpretting the Swagger API schema.

### Motivation
Why not use the client and model that is in the kubernetes repo?

Currently, the model and client are entangled with a lot of non-client code. So, importing those pacakges results in pull in a lot of dependencies.
Generating the model and using a simple HTTP client allows us to keep things nice and light.
